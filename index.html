                  attended St. Albans School in North London from 1953 to 1958.
                  It was while he was at this school that he developed a passion
                  for mathematics. This was a challenge in his household though
                  because his father wanted him to study medicine.

                  focus was on physics. The brilliant young man found his
                  studies at the university to be quite easy even though he
                  spends only a little amount of his time studying. In his final
                  year of study at the university, Hawking became very clumsy.

                Most of the threats we face come from the progress we’ve made in
                science and technology. We are not going to stop making
                progress, or reverse it, so we must recognize the dangers and
